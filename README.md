# ignite-demo
Demo project for apache ignite. I use this project to do some basic POC testing of Apache Ignite. 

Goals are:
* find out speed of some use cases I have, compared to the numbers I have of disk based solutions like Mongo and Elastic
* test reliability
* find out memory usage for different kinds of Object types
* And more
